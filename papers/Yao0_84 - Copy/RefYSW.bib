  Abstract                 = {The prospect of mimicking molecular chemistry with colloidal rather than molecular building blocks could enable unprecedented control over the properties of microstructured materials(1). The usual absence of directionality to the interaction between colloids has limited the complexity of the structures they can spontaneously form. One way to address this is to coat spherical colloid particles with a thin layer of nematic liquid crystal(2) and functionalize(3) the unavoidable defects or bold spots that arise when nematic order is established on the surface of a sphere(4,5). The number and arrangement of these defects can vary(2,6-16), providing flexibility for tuning directional interactions that are more difficult to achieve by other methods(17-26). Yet, many theoretically predicted structures have not been observed and control over defect location remains elusive. In this work, we show that varying the thickness of a nematic liquid crystal shell enables us to systematically control the number and orientation of defects formed. For thin shells, these defects can be engineered to emulate the linear, trigonal and tetrahedral geometries of sp, sp(2) and sp(3) carbon bonds, respectively. Such control opens up the possibility to engineer particles with tunable-valence and directional-binding capabilities.},

As predicted by previous theories of thin nematic shells we observe four s = + 1/2 defects. However, the predicted tetrahedral symmetry for the defects and the "baseball" director configuration is not observed. Instead the four defects are located, on average, on a great circle which splits the sphere into two hemispheres, each of which has a splay dominated director configuration. We argue that this result occurs as the bend elastic constant for hard rods is much larger than the splay elastic constant.},

Transitions between toroidal phases with different configurations of the order parameter and different aspect ratios are plotted as functions of the thermodynamic parameters.

  Abstract                 = {To explore the interaction between topological defects and curvature in materials with orientational order, we perform Monte Carlo studies of the two-dimensional XY model on the surface of curved substrates. Each curved surface is patterned with a random lattice constructed via random sequential absorption, and an XY spin is positioned at each lattice site. Spins lie in the plane locally tangent to the surface and interact with neighbors defined via a distance cutoff. We demonstrate that the relative phase associated with vortices is significant in curved geometries and plays a role in microstructural evolution. We also observe that any nonuniform curvature, e.g., on the surface of a torus, induces spontaneous segregation of positive and negative vortices and promotes the formation of deeply metastable defect microstructures. Though qualitative in nature, these observations provide novel insights into the patterning of topological defects in curved geometries and suggest that the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition maybe altered in geometries with nonuniform curvature.},

For the toroidal topology the total topological charge of TDs is equal to zero. We use a mesoscopic Landau-de Gennes approach which features a 2D nematic order tensor Q. We show that fat tori unbind TDs. If no extrinsic free energy couples Q with the Weingarten tensor of the torus{,} then defects and antidefects are assembled along the innermost and the outermost circles of the torus{,} respectively. In this case{,} we estimate the critical condition for the onset of TDs using an electrostatic analogy.

    abstract = { We have used a realistic model for double-stranded DNA and Monte Carlo simulations to compute the extension (mean span) of a DNA molecule confined in a nanochannel over the full range of confinement in a high ionic strength buffer. The simulation data for square nanochannels resolve the apparent contradiction between prior simulation studies and the predictions from Flory theory, demonstrating the existence of two transition regimes between weak confinement (the de Gennes regime) and strong confinement (the Odijk regime). The simulation data for rectangular nanochannels support the use of the geometric mean for mapping data obtained in rectangular channels onto models developed for cylinders. The comparison of our results with experimental data illuminates the challenges in applying models for confined, neutral polymers to polyelectrolytes. Using a Flory-type approach, we also provide an improved scaling result for the relaxation time in the transition regime close to that found in experiments. }

  abstract={The effect of cylindrical confinement on the phase behaviour of a system of parallel hard rods is studied using Onsager‚Äôs second-virial theory. The hard rods are represented as hard cylinders of diameter D and length L , while the cylindrical pore is infinite with diameter W . The interaction between the wall and the rods is hard repulsive, and it is assumed that molecules are parallel to the surface of the pore (planar anchoring). In very narrow pores ( D < W < 2 D ), the structure is homogeneous and the system behaves as a one-dimensional Tonks gas. For wider pores, inhomogeneous fluid structures emerge because of the lowering of the average excluded volume due to the wall‚Äìparticle interaction. The bulk nematic‚Äìsmectic A phase transition is replaced by a transition between inhomogeneous nematic and smectic A phases. The smectic is destabilized with respect to the nematic for decreasing pore width; this effect becomes substantial for W 100 D , results for bulk and confined fluids agree well due to the short range effect of the wall (‚àº3‚Äì4 D ).}

    abstract = { Abstract The co-existence concentrations of the isotropic and cholesteric liquid crystalline phases of the semi-flexible rod-like virus fd in aqueous suspension were measured as a function of ionic strength at room temperature. At several ionic strengths the magnetic-field-induced birefringence, which is proportional to the number of particles in a correlation volume N corr, was measured for fd concentrations spanning the entire isotropic region. From this data the limiting concentration of stability (spinodal) of the isotropic phase, œÅ*, was obtained. The co-existence concentrations and œÅ* versus ionic strength compare well with predictions based on the theory of Khokhlov and Semenov, modified to include the effects of charge. A theoretical expression for the magnetic birefringence of persistent polymers was derived and agreed well with the data with the exception that N corr at the isotropic to liquid crystal transition was smaller than predicted. }

Thin liquid crystalline shells surrounding and surrounded by aqueous phases can be conveniently produced using a nested capillary microfluidic system, as was first demonstrated by Fernandez-Nieves et al. in 2007. By choosing particular combinations of stabilizers in the internal and external phases, different types of alignment, uniform or hybrid, can be ensured within the shell. Here, we investigate shells in the nematic and smectic phases under varying boundary conditions, focusing in particular on textural transformations during phase transitions, on the interaction between topological defects in the director field and inclusions in the liquid crystal (LC), and on the possibility to relocate defects within the shell by rotating the shell in the gravitational field. We demonstrate that inclusions in a shell can seed defects that cannot form in a pristine shell, adding a further means of tuning the defect configuration, and that shells in which the internal aqueous phase is not density matched with the LC will gently rearrange the internal structure upon a rotation that changes the influence of gravity. Because the defects can act as anchor points for added linker molecules, allowing self-assembly of adjacent shells, the various arrangements of defects developing in these shells and the possibility of tuning the result by modifying boundary conditions, LC phase, thickness and diameter of the shell or applying external forces make this new LC configuration very attractive.

  abstract={In an elegant paper, Nelson suggested a method to produce tetravalent colloids based on a tetrahedral configuration created on the surface of a spherical particle. It emerges from a two-dimensional nematic liquid crystal placed on a sphere due to the presence of four 1/2 disclinations, i.e. , topological defects in the orientational order (Nelson D. R., Nano Lett. 2 (2002) 1125). In this paper we show that such a tetrahedral configuration also occurs in the wetting layers which form around spheres dispersed in a liquid crystal above the nematic-isotropic phase transition. Nematic wetting therefore offers an alternative route towards tetravalent colloids.}

By using the exact expression for the excluded volume kernel (Velasco E and Mederos L 1998 J. Chem. Phys. 109 2361) and solving the appropriate Euler-Lagrange equation entirely numerically, we have been able to extend our theoretical predictions into the nematic phase, which had up till now remained relatively unexplored due to the high computational cost. Simulation reveals a rich adsorption behaviour with increasing bulk density, which is described semi-quantitatively by the theory without any adjustable parameters.}

abstract  ="Cells use actin filaments to define and maintain their shape and to exert forces on the surrounding tissue. Accessory proteins like crosslinkers and motors organize these filaments into functional structures. However{,} physical effects also influence filament organization: steric interactions impose packing constraints at high filament density and spatially confine the filaments within the cell boundaries. Here we investigate the combined effects of packing constraints and spatial confinement by growing dense actin networks in cell-sized microchambers with nonadhesive walls. We show that the filaments spontaneously form dense{,} bundle-like structures above a threshold concentration of 1 mg ml-1{,} in contrast to unconfined networks{,} which are homogeneous and undergo a bulk isotropic-to-nematic phase transition above 5 mg ml-1. Bundling requires quasi-2D confinement in chambers with a depth comparable to the mean filament length (6 [small mu ]m). The bundles curve along the walls and central bundles align along the chamber diagonal or{,} in elongated chambers{,} along the long axis. We propose that bundling is a result of the polydisperse length distribution of the filaments: filaments shorter than the chamber depth introduce an entropic depletion attraction between the longest filaments{,} which are confined in-plane. Bundle alignment reflects a competition between bulk liquid-crystalline ordering and alignment along the boundaries. This physical mechanism may influence intracellular organization of actin in combination with biochemical regulation and actin-membrane adhesion."}

An extremum principle for eigensolutions is formulated. The exact solution of the differential equation for a polymer in a harmonic potential is given. A lower bound for the confinement free energy of a polymer in a tube is obtained.}

The isotropic-anisotropic transition has first-order characteristics and can be compared with the isotropic-nematic transition observed in lyotropic polymer systems, both driven by the excluded-volume interaction. Unlike a nematic state, the anisotropic state observed here displays the so-called tennis-ball conformation, coupling the polymer-segment orientation preference with positional order.}

The equation of Hu et al. gives the I‚ÄìN transition pressure and density in good agreement with computer simulation by Wilson and Allen for a semi-flexible hard-sphere chain consisting of seven segments. For real semi-flexible polymers, we follow the Khokhlov‚ÄìSemenov theory of persistent chains that introduces chain flexibility into the Onsager theory. Using a consistent procedure to regress the equation-of-state parameters, the equations of Chapman et al. and Hu et al. are also compared with the theory of DuPr√© and Yang that uses the equation of Lee for hard spherocylinders. These models are compared with experiment for two binary polymer solutions containing poly(hexyl isocyanate) and another solution containing polysaccharide schizophyllan. The concentration of polymer at the I‚ÄìN transition is predicted as a function of the molecular weight of polymer. All models perform similarly and show semi-quantitative agreement with experiment.

@article{Ben-Shaul2013,
abstract = {Inspired by novel single-molecule and bulk solution measurements, the physics underlying the forces and pressures involved in DNA packaging into bacteriophage capsids became the focus of numerous recent theoretical models. These fall into two general categories: Continuum-elastic theories (CT), and simulation studies-mostly of the molecular dynamics (MD) genre. Both types of models account for the dependence of the force, and hence the packaging free energy ($\Delta$F), on the loaded DNA length, but differ markedly in interpreting their origin. While DNA confinement entropy is a dominant contribution to $\Delta$F in the MD simulations, in the CT theories this role is fulfilled by interstrand repulsion, and there is no explicit entropy term. The goal of this letter is to resolve this apparent contradiction, elucidate the origin of the entropic term in the MD simulations, and point out its tacit presence in the CT treatments.},

abstract = {Bundles of filamentous actin (F-actin) form primary structural components of a broad range of cytoskeletal processes including filopodia, sensory hair cell bristles and microvilli. Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) allow the cell to tailor the dimensions and mechanical properties of the bundles to suit specific biological functions. Therefore, it is important to obtain quantitative knowledge on the effect of ABPs on the mechanical properties of F-actin bundles. Here we measure the bending stiffness of F-actin bundles crosslinked by three ABPs that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. We observe distinct regimes of bundle bending stiffness that differ by orders of magnitude depending on ABP type, concentration and bundle size. The behaviour observed experimentally is reproduced quantitatively by a molecular-based mechanical model in which ABP shearing competes with F-actin extension/compression. Our results shed new light on the biomechanical function of ABPs and demonstrate how single-molecule properties determine mesoscopic behaviour. The bending mechanics of F-actin fibre bundles are general and have implications for cytoskeletal mechanics and for the rational design of functional materials.},

abstract  ="An efficient and convenient numerical approach to calculate the structure factor of a wormlike chain model is proposed by directly dealing with a formal solution of the Green{'}s function. A precise numerical representation of the structure factor of the wormlike chain model is then obtained{,} for arbitrary chain rigidity. On one hand{,} in the flexible limit{,} the numerical results recover the well-known Debye function of the structure factor of a Gaussian chain and furthermore predict the correct large-k behavior that a Gaussian model fails to capture; on the other hand{,} in the rigid limit{,} the numerical results recover the well-known Neugebauer function of the structure factor of a rigid rod. Based on the calculated structure factor{,} the random phase approximation is employed to study the physical properties of the order-disorder transition for asymmetric wormlike diblock copolymers; particularly{,} the spinodal line of the disordered phase is calculated. For the case of symmetric diblock copolymer microphase separation{,} the present calculation reproduces the phase boundary previously determined by self-consistent field theories and yields the entire picture crossing over from the flexible-chain limit to the rigid-chain limit."}

The knowledge of these coefficients enabled us to resum the moment expansion of G ( r , N ) by taking into account consecutively the deviations of the moments from their stiff rod limit. Within this procedure we have derived the short-chain expansion for G ( r , N ), the scattering function, and the extension‚Äìforce relation, which take into account the deviations of the moments from their stiff rod limit to the seventh orderin N .}

abstract = {The importance of hydrophobic interactions in determining polymer adsorption and wrapping of carbon nanotubes is still under debate. In this work, we concentrate on the effect of short-ranged weakly attractive hydrophobic interactions between polymers and nanotubes (modeled as an infinitely long and smooth cylindrical surface), neglecting all other interactions apart for chain flexibility. Using coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulation of such simplified systems, we find that uniform adsorption and wrapping of the nanotube occur for all degrees of chain flexibility for tubes with sufficiently large outer radii. However, the adsorbed conformations depend on chain stiffness, ranging from randomly adsorbed conformations of the flexible chain to perfect helical or multihelical conformations (in the case of more concentrated solutions) of the rigid chains. Adsorption appears to occur in a sequential manner, wrapping the nanotube nearly one monomer at a time from the point of contact. Once adsorbed, the chains travel on the surface of the cylinder, retaining their helical conformations for the semiflexible and rigid chains. Our findings may provide additional insight to experimentally observed ordered polymer wrapping of carbon nanotubes.},

As it turns out, an additional term exists, that couples the rotating local coordinate frame with an orientation differential operator; this term has not been previously documented. In addition, for a wormlike chain moving on a curved surface, the external-field term needs to be supplemented by a surface curvature energy penalty.},

@article{Smyda2012,
abstract = {The confinement of a polymer into a small space is thermodynamically unfavorable because of the reduction in the number of conformational states. The entropic penalty affects a variety of biological processes, and it plays an important role in polymer transport properties and in microfluidic devices. We determine the entropic penalty for the confinement of elastic polymer of persistence length P in the long-chain limit. We examine three geometries: (1) parallel planes separated by a distance d (a slit); (2) a circular tube of diameter d; and (3) a sphere of diameter d. We first consider infinitely thin (ideal) chains. As d/P drops from 100 to 0.01, T$\Delta$S rises from ‚àº5 √ó 10(-4) kT to ‚àº30 kT per persistence length for cases (1) and (2), with the entropic penalty for case (2) being consistently about twice that for case (1). T$\Delta$S is ‚àº5 kT per persistence length for confinement to a sphere when d = P, about twice the value predicted by mean field theory. For all three geometries, in the limit d/P ‚â´ 1, the asymptotic behavior of $\Delta$S vs d is consistent with the d(-2) behavior predicted by theory. In the limit d/P ‚â™ 1, the scaling of $\Delta$S for slits and tubes is also consistent with earlier predictions (d(-2/3)). Finally, we treat volume exclusion effects, examining chains of diameter D > 0. Confinement to a narrow slit or tube (d/P ‚â™ 1) has the same entropic penalty as that for an ideal chain in a slit or tube with d' = d - D; in the weak confinement regime (d/P ‚â´ 1), the entropic penalties are significantly larger than those for infinitely thin chains. When a chain of finite diameter is forced into a sphere or other closed cavity, the entropic confinement penalty rises without limit because there are no configurations available to the chain once its volume exceeds that of the cavity.},

@article{Tzlil2003,
abstract = {In a previous communication (Kindt et al., 2001) we reported preliminary results of Brownian dynamics simulation and analytical theory which address the packaging and ejection forces involving DNA in bacteriophage capsids. In the present work we provide a systematic formulation of the underlying theory, featuring the energetic and structural aspects of the strongly confined DNA. The free energy of the DNA chain is expressed as a sum of contributions from its encapsidated and released portions, each expressed as a sum of bending and interstrand energies but subjected to different boundary conditions. The equilibrium structure and energy of the capsid-confined and free chain portions are determined, for each ejected length, by variational minimization of the free energy with respect to their shape profiles and interaxial spacings. Numerical results are derived for a model system mimicking the lambda-phage. We find that the fully encapsidated genome is highly compressed and strongly bent, forming a spool-like condensate, storing enormous elastic energy. The elastic stress is rapidly released during the first stage of DNA injection, indicating the large force (tens of pico Newtons) needed to complete the (inverse) loading process. The second injection stage sets in when approximately 1/3 of the genome has been released, and the interaxial distance has nearly reached its equilibrium value (corresponding to that of a relaxed torus in solution); concomitantly the encapsidated genome begins a gradual morphological transformation from a spool to a torus. We also calculate the loading force, the average pressure on the capsid's walls, and the anisotropic pressure profile within the capsid. The results are interpreted in terms of the (competing) bending and interaction components of the packing energy, and are shown to be in good agreement with available experimental data.},

We demonstrate that it is possible to control the extent of this ejection by varying the external osmotic pressure. In the particular case of bacteriophage lambda, the ejection is 50\% inhibited by osmotic pressures (of polyethylene glycol) comparable to those operative in the cytoplasm of host bacteria; it is completely suppressed by a pressure of 20 atmospheres. Furthermore, our experiments monitor directly a dramatic decrease of the stress inside the unopened phage capsid upon addition of polyvalent cations to the host solution, in agreement with many recent theories of DNA interactions.},

The simulation data for square nanochannels resolve the apparent contradiction between prior simulation studies and the predictions from Flory theory, demonstrating the existence of two transition regimes between weak confinement (the de Gennes regime) and strong confinement (the Odijk regime). The simulation data for rectangular nanochannels support the use of the geometric mean for mapping data obtained in rectangular channels onto models developed for cylinders. The comparison of our results with experimental data illuminates the challenges in applying models for confined, neutral polymers to polyelectrolytes. Using a Flory-type approach, we also provide an improved scaling result for the relaxation time in the transition regime close to that found in experiments.},

abstract = {Conformations and structural transitions of polyelectrolytes strictly confined onto a spherical 2D surface have been investigated by scaling descriptions based on physical arguments concerning polyelectrolyte adsorption onto planar surface and liquid crystals as well as by Monte Carlo simulations using a bead-spring model with short-range and electrostatic repulsions. In case of the electrostatic screened regime, a disordered-ordered (spiral) transition at increasing persistence length of the chain was found. It was predicted that the transition occurred when the persistence length is comparable with the mean spacing between adjacent strands of the ordered chain. The presence of a non-screened electrostatic repulsion led to a more complex behavior with i) a re-entrant order-disorder transition and ii) a tennis ball texture as an additional smectic/nematic structure. The various competing structures given by the theory were recovered by the Monte Carlo simulations, which also indicated that the tennis ball texture was favored over the spiral structure by the long-range interactions for semi-flexible chains.},

@article{Olson2001,
abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of DNA-filled, bacteriophage T4 isometric capsids has been determined by means of cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction techniques. The packing geometry of protein subunits on the capsid surface was confirmed to be that of the triangulation class T = 13. The reconstruction clearly shows pentamers, attributed to capsid protein gp24*, surrounded by hexamers of the major capsid protein, gp23*. Positions of the accessory proteins, Hoc and Soc, are also clearly delineated in the surface lattice. The Hoc protein is the most prominent surface feature and appears as an extended molecule with a rounded base from which a thin neck and a globular head protrude. One Hoc molecule associates with each hexamer. Nearly continuous "ridges" are formed at the periphery of the gp23* hexamers by an association of 12 Soc molecules; however, Soc is absent along the boundaries between the hexamers and the pentamers. The duplex DNA genome forms a highly condensed series of concentric layers, spaced about 2.36 nm apart, that follow the general contour of the inner wall of the protein capsid.},

Candidates for such coatings include triblock copolymers, gemini lipids, metallic or semiconducting nanorods, and conventional liquid crystal compounds. We estimate the size of the relevant nematic Frank constants, discuss how to obtain other valences and analyze the thermal distortions of ground-state configurations of defects on the sphere. }

The isotropic-anisotropic transition has first-order characteristics and can be compared with the isotropic-nematic transition observed in lyotropic polymer systems, both driven by the excluded-volume interaction. Unlike a nematic state, the anisotropic state observed here displays the so-called tennis-ball conformation, coupling the polymer-segment orientation preference with positional order.

  abstract={An overview is given of theory and experiments on liquid crystal phases which appear in solutions of elongated colloidal particles or stiff polymers. The Onsager (1949) virial theory for the isotropic-nematic transition of thin rodlike particles is treated comprehensively along with extensions to polydisperse solutions and soft interactions. Computer simulations of liquid crystal phases in hard particle fluids are summarized and used to assess the quality of statistical mechanical theories for stiff particles at higher volume fraction-like the inclusion of higher virial coefficients, y-expansion, scaled particle theory and density functional theory. Both computer simulations and density functional theory indicate formation of more highly ordered smectic phases. The range of experimental applicability is strongly widened by the extension of the virial theory to wormlike chains by Khokhlov and Semenov (1981,1982). Finally, experimental results for a number of carefully studied, charged and uncharged colloids and polymers are summarized and compared to theoretical results. In many cases the agreement is semi-quantitative.}
